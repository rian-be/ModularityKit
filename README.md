Build scalable, modular .NET applications faster and more efficiently.
Modularity is a high-performance framework for creating flexible, modular systems with easy integration of custom components, efficient inter-module communication, and built-in tools for debugging and testing.

### **Key Features**
* **Modular Systems** – easily integrate and extend components.
* **Pipeline & Middleware** – define and execute processing chains efficiently.
* **Signals** – type-safe event system for inter-module communication.
* **Debugging & Testing** – built-in support for inspecting and testing.
* **High Performance** – precompiled pipelines and minimal runtime overhead.

### **Why Modularity?**
* Building large-scale applications often leads to tightly-coupled code and complex dependencies. Modularity addresses these challenges by:
* Encouraging clear separation of concerns between modules.
* Providing typed context and signals to safely pass data across components.
* Supporting event-driven communication for decoupled, maintainable architectures.
* Optimizing performance with precompiled execution paths.
